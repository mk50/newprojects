 
 assume the following history the cuurent branch is topic:
 
               A--B--C topic
              /
           D--E--F--G master
   
   I have a master branch D E F G  and at commit E I make A B C brunch on topic
   in this case  master branch doesn’t know anything about topic brunch 
   and topik branch doesn’t know anything about F and G 
  then I have to make a PULL from topic to master and do a merge from master to toppic
  
   befor rebase
   E is a base 
 
  from this point the result of the following command:
  
 git rebase master
 git rebase master topic

 whould be:
  
            A'--B'--C' topic
            /
  D--E--F--G  master
   
  after rebase G is a base

 A' AND B' AND C' is make rebase for them
